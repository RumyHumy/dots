This is first of (I hope) many notes. I will always start something like that and not a week passes and I just forget or don't want to. I hope this time will be better.

Today, my Digital Diary, I feel hatred deep within my soul, because I got to do fucking lab report.

And I keep telling myself this things:
1) Faster you get it done sooner you will be doing things that you really like 
2) It's somewhat helpful, you will know more about volmeters, oscilloscopes and whatnot
3) Discipline is the thing that will help you also with other things
4) It will develop your intellegence in some way, like, you need to think, ain't that right?
5) You got to do this, mom and dad will be sad

But I just can't focus, the pain of doing what I don't want and doing it in a way that encourages hatred to the subject sometimes becomes physical.
